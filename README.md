As the third and final part of the Accounting App this UI is runnable only if a database is created and modified before.
To create a database you need to run "Create-Database" app.

After running the above apps which are available in https://github.com/szamani20/Accounting-App_Create-Database 
and in https://github.com/szamani20/Accounting-App_Sale you can run this code.
Be careful to put the database file in the same directory where the code is.
